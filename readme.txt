help me create a resume: at this point, i want a Summary or objective statement. 
what should it look like?
let me tell you a little about myself....hopefully it will help you to help me

i started programming in 1978... i held a job at princess hotels from 1978 till 1997. i started as a computer operator, became a programmer -an RPG Programmer/ on my own and with the help of programmers. in 1985 i became the manager of the MIS department, - i was a hands on manager, meaning i did everything. had a staff or 2 or 3 operators and another programmer. eventually there were two, three other programmers. eventually the company was sold, and i looked for another job. I was hired as a programmer (by then RPG 4, working on the ibm as400) jan 1 1998 and
worked with Affiliated Computer Services till retirement on December 2021. By then Affiliated Computer Services went thru several ownership changes. We became Xerox about 2010. Then the tech division was sold off to Cognizant in 2013 about.
then in 2016 we were re-aquired by Conduent.

At princess Hotels:
being the manager i was responsible for the ibm System 38. Responsible for it to be available 7 days a week
during business hours. it was a cumstom-made reservations system. we took reservations for company hotels.
at night we transmitted the reservation information to the properties. we took individual reservations,
group reservations. for the last 10 years we also had flight reservations because we had a chartered airplane
that flew from 7 cities in the US to our casino hotel in the bahamas. i was responsible for making changes
to the system.

At affiliated computer services, i was assinged to the MFS (Massachusets financial services) account.
this position i held until retirement. MFS was our biggest client. I maintained and made enhancements to the
system. again, this was a custom-made system. eventually i was made manager, and had 3 programmers
working for me.

what kind of job do i want?
a web developer related job.
i am learning html, css and javascript, as well as python
so i would like a job in that realm.
